# Fit-Amazing

1. Introduction 

❖Topic: 
We want to make a platform named “Fit amazing” that client can find clothing which best fits their bodies. 
When users input the data of their figures, the system will go through the database to find the clothes that satisfied users’ requirements.  

❖What is the function of system and how to use it 

We provide two types of identity “Buyer” or “Seller” for users to choose. Buyers can enter their stature to find clothes. 
Sellers can easily upload products on database and have their own stores online. 
For example: if you enter your shoulder width 40 cm, then the searched results will show all clothes that contains this size. 

❖What is the propose of using system 

To satisfy the client’s requirements by shortening the time to find clothes that suits you. 

❖Motivation 

With the advancement of technology, the demand for e-commerce is increasing.
More and more people uses e-commerce to shop instead of going physical shopping, and we found that clothing accounts for a large
proportion of products purchased online. However, due to the different webpages of the clothing online store, we cannot effectively and quickly confirm whether clothing is the right size. Thus, we want to create a platform that can quickly and accurately find clothes that suit you by inputting the data of your figure. 

❖Feature 

1. Quickly find the clothing that fit you  
In order to precisely search the clothing, buyers have to input the data of figure like person’s height, 
chest measurement and so on. At the same time, sellers have to upload the recommended size range to the database. 
Then after buyers enter the data, we can use it to rapidly compare them in the database and present the results to buyers.  
2. Everyone can easily be the seller without auditing and own stores online  
During the registration phase, we provide users of the option choosing the identity. 
We hope that all transactions on this platform can be fast and easy. Thus, we don’t have the step of auditing. Everyone in this platform can easily be the seller and own stores online
